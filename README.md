small script for updating all of my vim bundles. Possibly duplicates
fuctionality in git itself or something like vundle. Mostly I wanted to play
with the git module for python. I also have more testing to do before it's
solid--I get an assert error under conditions I can't seem to reporoduce. Early
days.
